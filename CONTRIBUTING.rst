there is space for you here.

Guidelines for Contributing
===========================

We are grateful for all contributions, from correcting typos to
improving configurations and extending tutorials and examples. However,
for new ideas it is preferred to open a new issue rather than to submit
a Pull Request with changes. This is respectful because it involve the
community and gives notice to other users that you are already working
on a certain topic so that others may do something else.

Good to know when contributing:

* All ideas are welcome.

* For typos and grammar errors simply open a new pull request with the
  correct changes there is no need to elaborate.

* This project is meant to be educational so try to be as detailed and
  clear as possible when writing an issue so that others can learn
  something from reading it, e.g., examples and references are warmly
  welcome.

* Aim to be inclusive. Vim is supported on many platforms so try to find
  cross-platform solutions that works for users in different OSs.

* Whether you use Vim or Neovim try to understand how your solution fits
  in the other environment (after all everyone wants to learn something
  new here). If for some reason you can't do that than at least clearly
  state it.

* When you are writing a Pull Request be sure that there is sufficient
  information provided (referencing to an earlier issue is a perfect way
  for doing this). Make a useful commit message (if you don't know what
  how see git/git project because they are amazing in this aspect).
