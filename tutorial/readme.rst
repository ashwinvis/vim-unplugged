To start the tutorial do the following:

* Copy the configuration from README_ to your ``~/.vimrc`` or
  ``~/.config/nvim/init.vim``

* Open the `place_01.rst <place_01.rst>`_ file with Vim

  .. code:: bash

  or Neovim

  .. code:: bash

    $ nvim place_01.rst

* Follow the instructions from there on in your Vim/Neovim

.. Warning::

  The tutorials are writen in reStructured which is a markup langauge.
  Commands (as well as the outputs of the commands) are enclosed between

  ``command`` you should type it in your Vim session without the double
  quotes.
